# dbt_sage_intacct_source v0.1.2
 
## Updates
- Removed the `_fivetran_deleted` filter in the `stg_sage_intacct__gl_account`. We saw there were records in the `gl_detail` table that were associated with accounts that were deleted, which affected our joins and bubbled up later in the final P&L and balance sheet models. By removing the filter the balances tie out. However, we've kept `_fivetran_deleted` as a column so the user may filter that out on their own.
